# Nigerian Youth Mentor GPT

Nigerian Youth Mentor GPT is a culturally grounded custom GPT solution I built to support and empower Nigerian youth between the ages of 16–30. This AI-powered mentor was designed to provide practical career advice, emotional support, and motivational storytelling that speaks directly to the everyday realities of Nigerian life — from NEPA wahala and job scarcity to japa dreams and tech aspirations.

The idea for this GPT came from observing the massive gap in mentorship, career resources, and emotional support for youth navigating Nigeria's challenging economic landscape. Many young people have ambition but lack access to personalized, grounded advice tailored to their unique situations — whether they're working with just a smartphone or struggling with inconsistent electricity and poor internet.

I designed Nigerian Youth Mentor GPT through OpenAI's platform to meet these needs. It acts like a digital big brother/sister who understands local struggles and speaks the language — literally and culturally.

## What's Under The Hood?

Nigerian Youth Mentor GPT leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o — the most advanced model to date. To enrich its performance and relevance, I integrated several tools and strategies:

- **Apify**: A cloud-based web scraping tool used to gather real-time data from platforms like AltSchool Africa, Jobberman, and Nigerian education or training initiatives.
- **OpenAI Browser Tool**: Allows real-time access to up-to-date info for scholarships, training programs, and success stories.
- **Image Generator Tool**: Produces custom motivational visuals that resonate with Nigerian youth culture.
- **Multi-Mode System**:
  - **Career Builder Mode** for personalized growth roadmaps.
  - **Success Stories Mode** for local inspiration.
  - **Naija Real Talk Mode** for mental and emotional support.

The result? An AI mentor that’s smart, culturally aware, emotionally supportive, and truly useful — even if you’re starting with just WhatsApp and hope.
